# Firefox (private) launcher implementing a strict Firejail profile (see firefox-custom.profile and nolocal netfilter)
#
# Notes: -Same as Firefox launcher, but this will start FF without your user profile (e.g. a temporary, new profile)
#        -Lots of testing to get this as far as I could push without 'breaking' the browser
#         and is much more conservative than the profile shipped with stock firejail.
#        -CONFIG_USER_NS kernel config required for Arch Linux (for proper namespace support)
#        -Confirm with `zgrep USER_NS /proc/config.gz`
#
# ****** -If it breaks: 1) Check the default gateway (see man firejail).
# ******                2) Remove 'net' flag if on wifi (see man firejail)
#        -Plumbing: firefox -> symlink to /usr/local/bin/firefox -> this script -> calls firefox2 (within a jail)
#                   firefox2 -> original firefox as installed
#                   I wish I remembered now why I needed to implement this workaround.. BUT ... not going to try
#                   to redo/fix a working design at this point. I think it was a workaround for the desktop launcher, and
#                   xdg link opening, but alas no notes (:
#        TODO: 1) Passing a URL to Firefox opens to the start page, not the URL. I suspect it's the redirect FF->FF2, but haven't
#              looked too far into it.!/usr/bin/bash
#              2) Make a default user.js for Firefox private so that appropriate defaults are used
#        Install: Copy the firefox launcher (in Arch Linux located at /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop) to something like
#                 firefox-private.desktop Modify the appropriate exec lines in the desktop file to execute this launcher.
